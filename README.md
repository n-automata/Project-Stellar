## What does it do? 
This server GUI application logs messages and states to a text file and also provides information such as the number of received messages and the date/time of received messages. 

## Additional Info 
Project Stellar is built using a video tutorial on YouTube as this is my first time working with C# and WPF. Undoubtedly, many improvements can be made, however, this is simply an initial dive into a new language and framework while tying in networking programming.
